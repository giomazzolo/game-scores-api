# üéÆ Game Scores API

A Go-based API for tracking game scores, built with PostgreSQL and containerized with Docker. This project is designed to be run with a hybrid approach, where the database runs in Docker for consistency, and the Go code can be run locally for rapid development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Go** (version 1.24.4 or later)
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

---

## üíª Docker Containers Set-up

This is the recommended workflow for active development. It provides the stability of a containerized database while allowing you to run and debug your Go code locally for maximum speed.

### Step 1: Start the Containers

This command builds the Server, the PostgreSQL database, the Prometheus and Grafana services and runs them in the background. The server will start listening on `http://localhost:8080`. All system and environmental variables are configured in `docker-composer.yml`.

**Run:**
```powershell
docker-compose build --build-arg CACHE_BUSTER=$(Get-Date -UFormat %s); docker-compose up
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations and Seed the Database

Now you need to execute the migration and seeder scripts. Both scripts run from your local machine and connect to the Dockerized database. The migration script creates all the necessary tables, the seeder script adds an admin user to the database which can be used for testing.

First, we need to set up the BD_SOURCE env variable to let our local machine know how to connect to the dockerized database. The configs used are the same as in the docker-compose.

**1 - On a new terminal, run:**

> **On Windows (PowerShell):**
> ```powershell
> $env:DB_SOURCE="postgresql://user:mysecretpassword@localhost:5433/mydatabase?sslmode=disable"; go run ./cmd/migrate; go run ./cmd/seeder
> ```

> **On macOS / Linux:**
> ```bash
> export DB_SOURCE="postgresql://user:mysecretpassword@localhost:5433/mydatabase?sslmode=disable"; go run ./cmd/migrate; go run ./cmd/seeder
> ```

> **Note:** We are using port `5433` to avoid conflicts with any local PostgreSQL installations.


After this, everything will be setup correctly and the API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üîÅ Stop and Restart

**To stop the containers run:**

```powershell
docker-compose stop
```

Alternatively, press `ctrl + c` on the terminal where it is running, or stop the containers with the Docker application.

**To re-run the containers, use the same command as in Step 1**:
```powershell
docker-compose build --build-arg CACHE_BUSTER=$(Get-Date -UFormat %s); docker-compose up
```

## üß™ Running the Integration Tests

The project includes a full integration test suite that automatically sets up and tears down its own environment.

**To run all tests, all containers must be running.**
Execute the following command from the project root:
```powershell
go clean -testcache; go test -v -timeout 5m ./cmd/api
```

The expected test results output should look like this:

```
--- PASS: TestAPIFlow (2.95s)
    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/Admin_Login (0.08s)
    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/Register_API (0.93s)

        --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/Login_API/Login_with_non-existent_user (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/Add_Game_API (0.05s)

    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/Update_Score_API (0.54s)
    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/List_Scores_API (0.03s)
    --- PASS: TestAPIFlow/List_Statistics_API (0.02s)
PASS
ok      game-scores/cmd/api     4.881s
```

API coverage: `login`, `register`, `add_game`, `list_games`, `join_games`, `update_score`, `list_scores`, `list_statistics`.

The API's `ping` and `metrics` are not included in testing.

## üõë Removing the Environment

To stop all running containers and **completely remove** the containers and volumes use the following command:

```powershell
docker-compose down -v
```

To start again, go back to the set-up section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Database: PostgreSQL with EntGo

* **PostgreSQL:** The api implemetation uses the PostgresSQL database, an open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and performance.
* **EntGo:** A modern entity framework for Go. We use Ent's "schema-as-code" approach to define our database tables and relationships directly in Go. This provides type-safety for all database queries, catching errors at compile time instead of at runtime. The schema is located in the `/ent/schema` directory.

### Database Schemas

The schemas defined in the database are:

* **Games:** Holds information about the game name and description
* **Users:** Holds username, email, password and role
* **Scores:** Relates a User to a Game and holds all the scores of all Users for any game they have joined.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    GAMES ||--o{ SCORES : "has"
    USERS ||--o{ SCORES : "has"

    GAMES {
        int id PK
        string name
        string description
    }

    SCORES {
        int id PK
        datetime created_at
        int game_scores
        int user_scores
    }

    USERS {
        int id PK
        string username
        string email
        string password_hash
        string role
    }
```

### HTTP Router: go-chi

Package [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) is a small, idiomatic and composable router for building HTTP services. We utilize this router for it's simplicity and cleanliness.


---

## üìä Telemetry & Monitoring with Grafana

The project includes a full observability stack to monitor the API's health and performance.

### How to Access

1.  **Start all services:** All services and containers must be running (See Setup)
2.  **Navigate to Grafana:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  **Login:** Use the default credentials:
    * **Username:** `admin`
    * **Password:** `admin`
4.  **Add Data Source:**
    * On the left menu, go to **Connections** > **Data sources**.
    * Click **"Add new data source"** and select **Prometheus**.
    * For the **"Prometheus server URL"**, enter `http://prometheus:9090`.
    * Click **Save & test**, you should see a pop-up `"Datasource updated"`
5.  **Import Dashboard**
    * On the left menu, go to **Dashboards**
    * Click **New** and select **Import**.
    * On the project root, to to `configs/grafana/` and select the file `dashboard.json`.
    * The dashboard should load with pre-configured visualizations and metrics.

You can now create dashboards to visualize the metrics exposed by the API at the `/metrics` endpoint.
